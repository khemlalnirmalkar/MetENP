# MetENP
Metabolite enrichment analysis and their associated enriched pathways.

## Introduction to Enrichment Pipeline

MetENP is a R package that enables detection of significant metabolites from metabolite information 
(names or names and concentration along with metadata information) and provides

1. Enrichment score of metabolite class,
2. Maps to pathway of the species of choice,
3. Calculate enrichment score of pathways,
4. Plots the pathways and shows the metabolite increase or decrease
5. Gets gene info, reaction info, enzyme info

For more info, check out the vignette.
